# README

- Payara 5 Web Profile based docker container with installed:
    - mysql jdbc ver. 8
    - Microsoft TTF core fonts
    - `domain.xml` with the mysql jdbc resource is OPTIONAL, and should be used as reference to add your own database connection.
    - `default-web.xml` has a couple of production related optimizations. See my 'INFO' section.


- `micro` dir is placeholder for future Payara Micro support.
