Payara 5 server-web based docker container with installed:
- mysql jdbc ver. 8
- Microsoft TTF core fonts, needed by birt reporting engine
- `domain.xml` with the mysql jdbc resource is OPTIONAL, and should be used as reference to add your own database connection.
- `default-web.xml` has a couple of production related optimizations. See my 'INFO' section.
